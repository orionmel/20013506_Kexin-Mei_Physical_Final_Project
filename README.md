Difficulties& Improvement:
=================================
1. When testing the speech recognition module, I have spent a lot of time exploring it because I have not touched this module. At present, there are still unstable problems after the test.
2. The light matrix is also more complicated, I need to write the shape I want
3. I tried soldering for a long time , because i havenâ€™t try this before

The possibility of future projects:
==========================================
1.	Continue to improve the current accessories, because voice input I only stored a few names, I think about whether in the future can be combined with AI database storage
2.	The sensitivity of speech input needs to be adjusted, and when I tested it, I found that there was an insensitivity problem in the speech module
3.	I want to make this topic practical in the future from the perspective of derivation, from the perspective of user experience, how to let others learn from the beginning to avoid the problem of name discrimination, you can try to use the current mobile phone and other devices for secondary design
